The Web-UI module handles the complete web interface - which is built up upon Angular and the Socket.IO as the communication method for the backend. It includes the user panel which helps the user to manage his storage online and the admin panel which allows the admins to create new spaces, users, etc.
The web interface can be adapted with web modules.
